gnome-gocryptfs
===============

![](https://github.com/cjermain/gnome-gocryptfs/workflows/Run%20Tests/badge.svg)

*gnome-gocryptfs* integrates [gocryptfs][cfs] folders into the GNOME desktop by storing
their passwords in the [keyring][gkr] and optionally mounting them at login (and
unmouting them at logout
[on most distribution](#automatically-unmount-gocryptfs-folders-on-logout)). This package
is a fork of the [gnome-encfs][gef] project.

*gnome-gocryptfs* allows you to use strong passwords for gocryptfs folders while still
mounting them painlessly (i.e. no password prompt).  This is an advantage over
automount solutions like *pam-encfs* and *pam-mount* which require to use the
same password for gocryptfs folders as for your local user account. This is bad
because local account passwords usually are weaker than those one should use
for encrypting online stored data, e.g. in a [Dropbox][dbx].

Download
--------

Checkout the source:

    $ git clone https://github.com/cjermain/gnome-gocryptfs

Installation
------------

    $ cd /path/to/gnome-gocryptfs
    $ install gnome-gocryptfs /usr/local/bin

**Note:** You can run *gnome-gocryptfs* right from the extracted package but to
make use of the automount feature at GNOME login, it must be placed somewhere
in *PATH* (as configured during a login to GNOME). Using the install command
above ensures this requirement is fulfilled.

Usage
-----

### Add a gocryptfs folder

Suppose you have a gocryptfs folder at `~/.Private.encrypted` which should get
mounted to `~/Private`. Make it known to *gnome-gocryptfs*:

    $ gnome-gocryptfs add ~/.Private.encrypted ~/Private
    gocryptfs config file [-]: <optional custom gocryptfs.conf location>
    gocryptfs password: <enter gocryptfs password>
    Mount at login [Y/n]: <say 'y' or 'n'>

This adds the gocryptfs path, its mount location and password to the GNOME keyring
and sets up a GNOME autostart entry to mount it at GNOME login (if enabled).

### Mount a gocryptfs folder

If you said *y* above to the login mount question, the gocryptfs folder gets
mounted automatically at GNOME login. If you prefer to mount on demand, you do
that with

     $ gnome-gocryptfs mount ~/Private

which looks up the password in the keyring and does the mounting without
the need to enter the password manually.

Unmount based on the path:

    $ gnome-gocryptfs unmount ~/Private

which can also take the mount path. Without a path, the unmount command
unmounts all tracked gocryptfs folders.

### Other tasks

You can also show, edit and remove gocryptfs folders handled by *gnome-gocryptfs*:

    $ gnome-gocryptfs -h

    usage: gnome-gocryptfs [-h] [--version]
                           {list,mount,unmount,add,edit,remove} ...

    Painlessly mount and manage gocryptfs folders using GNOME's keyring.

    positional arguments:
      {list,mount,unmount,add,edit,remove}
        list                List all gocryptfs items stored in the keyring
        mount               Mount all or selected paths stored in the keyring
        unmount             Unmount all or selected paths stored in the keyring
        add                 Add a new gocryptfs path to the keyring
        edit                Edit a gocryptfs item in the keyring
        remove              Remove a gocryptfs item from the keyring

    optional arguments:
        -h, --help            show this help message and exit
        --version             show program's version number and exit

    ...

Usage should be straight forward - otherwise [submit an issue][itr].

### Automatically unmount gocryptfs folders on logout

If your distribution uses systemd to handle user sessions, your gocryptfs folders
will be automatically mounted/unmounted at login/logout.

Otherwise, gocryptfs folders can still be automatically mount at login using GNOME's
autostart mechanism. Unfortunately there's no equivalent to GNOME's autostart scripts
which could be used to automatically unmount your gocryptfs folders on logout
(without shutting down).

However, there's a manual solution using a [GDM hook script][gdm]:
`/etc/gdm/PostSession/Default`. Open this file in an editor (requires *root*
privileges) and add these lines:

    mount -t fuse.gocryptfs | grep "user=$USER" | awk '{print $3}' | while read MPOINT ; do
        sudo -u $USER fusermount -u "$MPOINT"
    done

This script is executed whenever you logout from GNOME. With this line, it
looks for mounted gocryptfs folders of the user currently logging out. Then it
unmounts each, using the `fusermount` command (note that this command is
executed as *root*, that's why there is a `sudo -u $USER` before the
`fusermount` command).

This works independent of *gnome-gocryptfs*, i.e. it unmounts **any** gocryptfs folder
of the user logging out.
